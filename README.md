- To use the plugin, you need to have at least the second MCreator 2020.3 snapshots or newer.

- When you create a new workspace, you need to go to the Fabric Generator, and select Minecraft Fabric for 1.15.2 (0.8.2+build.194)

- Always back up your workspace before updating to a newer version of the plugin.
