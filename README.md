## Important Information
- If you have made a workspace with a version older than 0.4.0, you need to create a new one since the workspace format has changed.
- You must.
- Back up your workspace before updating to a newer version of the plugin.
- Mods will also require [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) to function properly, so when you want to play your mod, make sure you have fabric api.
