## Important Information
- If you have created a workspace with a version older than 0.4.0, you need to create a new one since the workspace format has been changed.

- To use the plugin, you need to have the last patch of MCreator 2020.3 or newer.

- Always back up your workspace before updating to a newer version of the plugin.

- Mods may also require [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) to function properly, so when you build your mod, make sure you have fabric api.
