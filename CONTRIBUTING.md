# Contributing to MCreator Fabric Generator

Since we have limited time, we would love to accept pull requests to get things done. We've also put a few ground rules so that pull requests can be maintained easily and follow the same codestyle.

## Rules 
* Use the `this` keyword everywhere for instance variables
* Create a single commit for each feature, rather than making a huge commit for everything
* Keep minor changes like bug fixes and spelling errors a seperate commit
* State all your changes
* Do *not* use newline brackets
* Do not send a huge pull request with multiple large and untraceable commits. Instead, create a single pull request for each major change.

You must also follow the code of conduct.
